    <h2>Introduction to AR</h2>
    The goal of this workshop is to provide an introduction to simulation through a simple AR web application. Thit tutorial is based on the Javascript-based AR library,
    <a href="https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js">AR.js</a>, built upon the <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a> and <a href="https://three.js.org">three.js</a> libraries.

    <h3>Tutorial</h3>

    <br/><br/>
    Create a new Github repository and name it whatever you like. For the purposes of this workshop, I'll be referring to it as "ar-workshop" Make sure it's set to public.
    Make a clone of the Github repository on your computer.

    <br/><br/>
    Create a new file and name it <span class="code">index.html</span>. When you run your application, this will be the first file that is read. Insert the following lines into your file:

    <div class="code">
      <pre>
        <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
      &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Test AR&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.3.0/aframe.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/dev/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body style="margin: 0; overflow: hidden;"&gt;
        &lt;a-scene embedded arjs&gt;

        &lt;a-entity camera&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;
        &lt;/a-scene&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>

    Let's break this down piece by piece.

    <br/><br/>
    The first part of this defines your HTML file. You have your header, which defines the title of your page, and two scripts. Since HTML is a markup language, it cannot run any logic
    besides text formatting. Thus, in order to use the AR.js library, we need to embed a couple of Javascript files so that the application knows to run those scripts, and where to get them from.

    <br/><br/>
    The second part of the block defines the body of the HTML file. Right now, we have just said that we want to initialize AR.js and we want to use the camera of our current device.

    <br/><br/>
    In order to view our model, we'll need to create a new folder, and call it <span class="code">assets</span>.

    <br/><br/>
    Next, we'll want to include the model we want to display when the marker is seen. Unzip <a href="https://raw.githack.com/nicolocarpignoli/location-based-ar-tutorial/master/static-on-html/assets/magnemite.zip">this</a>
    and add it to the "assets" folder.

    <br/><br/>
    Now that we have everything, let's add a marker. Underneath the a-scene tag, add the following lines:

      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;a-marker preset="hiro"&gt;
            &lt;a-entity
            position="0 0 0"
            rotation="0 180 0"
            scale="0.05 0.05 0.05"
            gltf-model="assets/magnemite/scene.gltf"
            &gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;
          &lt;/a-marker&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

    Let's break this code down again. The a-marker tag says that we want to use the default "hiro" marker. This is a AR.js preset, and can be found and downloaded <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hiro_marker_ARjs.png">here</a>. We set the gltf-model to the magnemite model. Rotation rotates the magnemite to be facing the user. Scale makes the
    model smaller than its original size. Finally, animation-mixer tells the model to use its own in-built animation.

    <br/><br/>
    Now let's try to run this. Go back to your repository in Github and go to Settings->Pages and enable Github Pages. Set the source to "Deploy from a branch" and set that branch
    to main. Commit and push to your repository. You should now be able to access your application at "https://<\your-username>.github.io/ar-workshop". If you notice your application not working properly, right click the page
    and click "Inspect" to see the contents of your file and view the console log to see what errors occurred while reading your file.

    <br/><br/>
    Once you have fixed the issues, you may now open up your application on your mobile phone and test it out! There are numerous variations from here. You can make multiple
    markers using different patterns, you can use different models so that instead of Magnemite, you have Pikachu floating around. The options are limitless.
